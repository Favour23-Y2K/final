Fix username and password validations (use javascript to validate before form is submitted)

for the connections, 

0 - declined / disconnected (when declined, you cannot request an addition within 48 hours)
1 - requested
2 - accepted
3 - blocked

...remember to switch user 1 and user_ 2 in a case of a new request
(or just delete their relationship / set as null [make nullable field])
really, just do whatever is suitable

for the chat,

0 - removed / exited (when declined, you cannot request an addition within 24 hours)
1 - admin
2 - member
3 - banned
